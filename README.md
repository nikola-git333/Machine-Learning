# Machine-Learning
### Throughout my schooling, I was most interested in Machine Learning
Assignments
- on first assignment the task was to analyze data(statistics, missing values, correlation, skewness), visualize data, create features, split the data and transform data with one Pipeline object.
- second assignment was to train model (previous one) using spot checking approach and cross-validation. Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV class and evaluate model. I took a step further and I was looking for a way to improve the model.
  I used other algorithms, optimized hyperparameters, created more features, cross validated, checked bias-variance tradeoff to prevent over-underfitting. And i think I finnaly got one good model.
